# MusicPlayer
In this project, I designed and developed an attractive and interactive Music Player User Interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created the basic structure using HTML, styled the interface with CSS to make it visually appealing, and added functionality using JavaScript to control music playback.
